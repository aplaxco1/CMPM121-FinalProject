CMPM 121 - Final Project
Group Members: Eduardo Alcaraz, Elizabeth Arnold, Ryan Hueckel, Autumn Plaxco


DESCRIPTION:
For this final project, we decided to create a mystery scene where you play as a crow, 
searching for treasures in an old abandoned graveyard in the middle of a mountain valley. Guided 
only by the dimly flickering light of a magical floating candle, the player can hop and soar around 
the scene, uncovering a variety of shiny treasures fit for a crow hidden between the old crypts and 
tombs. When all the treasures are found, it will unlock the hidden secrets of this mysterious graveyard: 
even more treasure!


VIDEO/EXECUTABLE:
Below is a Google Drive link to a video showcasing some of the main elements of our scene, as well
as two exectutable files which can be downloaded to play the game:
